Requirements
============

You need the MnSymbol fonts version 1.3 or better installed. They can be
obtained from CTAN (ftp://ftp.ctan.org). Note that the version currently
included MiKTeX is too old.

You also need some program to convert the OpenType fonts into Type1
format. If you have either LCDF Typetools or fontforge installed then
you can use one of the provided scripts:

o convert-lcdf is a Unix script that uses LCDF Typetools
  (http://www.lcdf.org/type/)
o convert-ff is a Unix script that uses fontforge
  (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net)
o convert.bat is a DOS script that uses LCDF Typetools

We strongly recommend the use of LCDF Typetools since these are able to create
the dotless j glyph. If you use other programs this glyph will be omitted.

Files
=====

The MinionPro distribution is split into several archives. Which of them
you need depends on the version of the fonts you have installed. We
support three different versions of MinionPro:

o 001.000: This is the first version which can still be found on old
  FontFolio CDs.
o 001.001: This is the version currently available for sale.
o 002.000: This version is included in recent Acrobat Reader
  installations.

If you have LCDF Typetools installed you can determine the version with
the otfinfo command. For example, for version 002.000 you get:

  $ otfinfo -v MinionPro-Regular.otf
  Version 2.012;PS 002.000;Core 1.0.38;makeotf.lib1.6.6565

In all cases you need the archive

o scripts.zip

For font version 002.000 we provide a single additional archive
containing everything else you need:

o base-v2.zip

For versions 001.000 and 001.001 the files are spread over several
archives:

o metrics-base-v1.zip: contains the metrics for Regular, Italic, Bold,
  and BoldItalic.
o metrics-full-v1.zip: contains additional metrics for Medium,
  MediumItalic, Semibold, and SemiboldItalic.
o metrics-opticals-v1.zip: contains the metrics for the Capt, Subh, and
  Disp optical shapes.
o enc-v1.000.zip: contains the encoding files for version 001.000.
o enc-v1.001.zip: contains the encoding files for version 001.001.

For example, if you have only the four basic weights in version 001.000
then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base-v1.zip
  enc-v1.000.zip

If you have all weights, but not the optical families, in version
001.001 then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base-v1.zip
  metrics-full-v1.zip
  enc-v1.001.zip

If you have all fonts in version 001.001 then you need

  scripts.zip
  metrics-base-v1.zip
  metrics-full-v1.zip
  metrics-opticals-v1.zip
  enc-v1.001.zip

Installing
==========

0) Select the directory you want to install the files into. Usually,
this will be the local TeX tree which, for most teTeX distributions, is

  /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local

For MiKTeX it might be

  C:\Programs\MiKTeX\localtexmf

1) Unpack the scripts archive into some working directory:

  $ mkdir /tmp/MinionPro
  $ cd /tmp/MinionPro
  $ unzip scripts.zip

2) Copy your OpenType font files into the otf directory.

  $ cp /some/path/*.otf otf

3) Convert the OpenType fonts into Type1 format:

  $ ./convert-lcdf   (or ./convert-ff, or use some other program)

For MiKTeX execute

  convert.bat

4) Copy the generated Type1 fonts into your local TeX tree:

  $ mkdir -p /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local/fonts/type1/adobe/MinionPro
  $ cp pfb/*.pfb /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local/fonts/type1/adobe/MinionPro

5) Unpack the other archives directly into the TeX tree, for example:

  $ cd /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local
  $ unzip metrics-base-v1.zip
  $ unzip metrics-full-v1.zip
  $ unzip enc-v1.001.zip

(You do not have to unpack the scripts archive which was only needed for
step 3.)

6) If you have an old TeX distribution you might need to move the
encoding files and the map file into another directory:

  $ cd /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local
  $ mkdir -p dvips/MinionPro
  $ mv fonts/enc/dvips/MinionPro/* dvips/MinionPro
  $ mv fonts/map/dvips/MinionPro/* dvips/MinionPro

7) Add the line

  Map MinionPro.map

to your updmap.cfg. Refresh the file database and run updmap:

  $ mktexlsr
  $ updmap

The corresponding commands for MiKTeX are:

  initexmf -u
  mkfntmap

If you are using MiKTeX you also have to change the line

  ENCPath=.;%R\dvips//;%R\fonts\enc//

in your miktex.ini to

  ENCPath=.;%R\dvips//;%R\fonts\enc//;%R\fonts\enc\dvips//

8) If you get errors about insufficient memory you might need to
increase the values of font_mem_size and font_max in your TeX
configuration. For most distributions, these can be changed in the file
texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf. For MiKTeX the file is called miktex.ini.

9) You can find the documentation in

  /usr/share/teTeX/texmf-local/doc/latex/MinionPro/MinionPro.pdf

10) Happy TeXing!
