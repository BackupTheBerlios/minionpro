Requirements
============

You need the MnSymbol fonts installed. They can be obtained from CTAN
(ftp://ftp.ctan.org).

You also need some program to convert the OpenType fonts into Type1
format. If you have either LCDF Typetools or fontforge installed then
you can use one of the provided scripts:

o convert-lcdf uses LCDF Typetools (http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/)
o convert-ff uses fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net)

Files
=====

The MinionPro distribution is split into several archives. Which of them
you need depends on the version of the fonts you have installed.

Metrics:

o MinionPro-base-metrics: metrics for Regular, Italic, Bold, and
  BoldItalic
o MinionPro-full-metrics: additional metrics for Medium, MediumItalic,
  Semibold, and SemiboldItalic
o MininoPro-opticals-metrics: metrics for Capt, Subh, and Disp versions

Encodings and map files:

MinionPro comes in three versions 1.000, 1.001, and 2.000. We provide
encoding files for 1.000 and 2.000:

For font version 1.000:

o MinionPro-base-enc-1
o MinionPro-full-enc-1
o MinionPro-opticals-enc-1

For font version 2.000:

o MinionPro-base-enc-2
o MinionPro-full-enc-2
o MinionPro-opticals-enc-2

For example, if you have only the four basic weights in version 2.000
then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-2

If you have all weights, but not the optical families, in version 1.000
then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-full-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-1
  MinionPro-full-enc-1

If you have all fonts in version 1.000 then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-full-metrics
  MininoPro-opticals-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-1
  MinionPro-full-enc-1
  MinionPro-opticals-enc-1

Installing
==========

1) Unpack the archives

  $ tar -xzvf MinionPro-*.tgz

2) Create a directory otf and copy your OpenType font files into it.

  $ mkdir otf
  $ cp /some/path/*.otf otf

3) Convert the OpenType fonts into Type1 format:

  $ ./convert-lcdf   (or ./convert-ff, or use some other program)

4) Run ./install You can specify the directory where the files
should be put. The default is $TEXMFLOCAL.

  $ ./install /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local

5) Add MinionPro.map to your updmap.cfg and run updmap.

6) If you get errors about insufficient memory you might need to increase
the values of font_mem_size and font_max in your TeX configuration. For most
distributions, these can be changed in the file texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf

7) You can find the documentation in

  $TEXMFLOCAL/doc/latex/MinionPro/MinionPro.pdf

8) Happy TeXing!
