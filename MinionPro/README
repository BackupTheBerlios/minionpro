Requirements
============

You need the MnSymbol fonts installed. They can be obtained from CTAN
(ftp://ftp.ctan.org).

You also need some program to convert the OpenType fonts into Type1
format. If you have either LCDF Typetools or fontforge installed then
you can use one of the provided scripts:

o convert-lcdf is a Unix script that uses LCDF Typetools
  (http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/)
o convert-ff is a Unix script that uses fontforge
  (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net)
o convert.bat is a DOS script that uses LCDF Typetools

Files
=====

The MinionPro distribution is split into several archives. Which of them
you need depends on the version of the fonts you have installed. We
support three different versions of MinionPro:

o 001.000: This is the first version which can still be found on
  FontFolio CDs.
o 001.001: This is the version currently available for sale on the Adobe
  website.
o 002.000: This version is included in recent Acrobat Reader
  installations.

For version 002.000 we provide a single archive containing everything
you need:

o MinionPro-base-v2.zip

For versions 001.000 and 001.001 there are several archives:

o MinionPro-metrics-base-v1.zip: contains the metrics for Regular,
  Italic, Bold, and BoldItalic.
o MinionPro-metrics-full-v1.zip: contains additional metrics for Medium,
  MediumItalic, Semibold, and SemiboldItalic.
o MinionPro-metrics-opticals-v1.zip: contains the metrics for the Capt,
  Subh, and Disp optical shapes.
o MinionPro-enc-v1.000.zip: contains the encoding files for version
  001.000.
o MinionPro-enc-v1.001.zip: contains the encoding files for version
  001.001.

For example, if you have only the four basic weights in version 001.000
then you need

  MinionPro-metrics-base-v1.zip
  MinionPro-enc-v1.000.zip

If you have all weights, but not the optical families, in version
001.001 then you need

  MinionPro-metrics-base-v1.zip
  MinionPro-metrics-full-v1.zip
  MinionPro-enc-v1.001.zip

If you have all fonts in version 001.001 then you need

  MinionPro-metrics-base-v1.zip
  MinionPro-metrics-full-v1.zip
  MinionPro-metrics-opticals-v1.zip
  MinionPro-enc-v1.001.zip

Installing
==========

1) Unpack the archives

  $ unzip MinionPro-XXX.zip

2) Copy your OpenType font files into the otf directory.

  $ cp /some/path/*.otf otf

3) Convert the OpenType fonts into Type1 format:

  $ ./convert-lcdf   (or ./convert-ff, or use some other program)

4) Run ./install You can specify the directory where the files
should be put. The default is $TEXMFLOCAL.

  $ ./install /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local

5) Add MinionPro.map to your updmap.cfg and run updmap.

6) If you get errors about insufficient memory you might need to
increase the values of font_mem_size and font_max in your TeX
configuration. For most distributions, these can be changed in the file
texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf. For MiKTeX the file is called miktex.ini.

7) You can find the documentation in

  $TEXMFLOCAL/doc/latex/MinionPro/MinionPro.pdf

8) Happy TeXing!
