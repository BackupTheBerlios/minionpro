Requirements
============

You need the MnSymbol fonts installed. They can be obtained from CTAN
(ftp://ftp.ctan.org).

You also need some program to convert the OpenType fonts into Type1
format. If you have either LCDF Typetools or fontforge installed then
you can use one of the provided scripts:

o convert-lcdf uses LCDF Typetools (http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/)
o convert-ff uses fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net)

Files
=====

The MinionPro distribution is split into several archives. Which of them
you need depends on the version of the fonts you have installed.

Metrics:

o MinionPro-base-metrics: metrics for Regular, Italic, Bold, and
  BoldItalic
o MinionPro-full-metrics: additional metrics for Medium, MediumItalic,
  Semibold, and SemiboldItalic
o MininoPro-opticals-metrics: metrics for Capt, Subh, and Disp versions

Encodings and map files:

MinionPro comes in three versions 1.000, 1.001, and 2.000. We provide
encoding files for 1.000 and 2.000:

For font version 1.000:

o MinionPro-base-enc-1
o MinionPro-full-enc-1
o MinionPro-opticals-enc-1

For font version 2.000:

o MinionPro-base-enc-2
o MinionPro-full-enc-2
o MinionPro-opticals-enc-2

For example, if you have only the four basic weights in version 2.000
then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-2

If you have all weights, but not the optical families, in version 1.000
then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-full-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-1
  MinionPro-full-enc-1

If you have all fonts in version 1.000 then you need

  MinionPro-base-metrics
  MinionPro-full-metrics
  MininoPro-opticals-metrics
  MinionPro-base-enc-1
  MinionPro-full-enc-1
  MinionPro-opticals-enc-1

Installing
